</h2>

<p class="small">

	Consensus protocols perform differently due to different network, workload, and deploy- ment conditions. This paper devoted to make a comparison in LANs and WANs between single-leader, multi-leader, hierarchical multi-leader, and leaderless (opportunistic leader) consensus protocols. 
</p>

<p class="small">

	To model consensus performance, the paper estimates the average latency.<br>
		<b>latency</b> = w<sub>Q</sub> + &mu; + D<sub>L</sub>  + D<sub>Q</sub>  <br>
		latency &#x2192; total time that takes client to reach consensus <br> 
		w<sub>Q</sub> &#x2192; round's queue waiting time <br>
		&mu; &#x2192; How long it takes the leader to process all messages for a given round<br>
		D<sub>L</sub> &#x2192; network delays between client and leader <br>
		D<sub>Q</sub> &#x2192; network delays between leader and follower in a quorum<br>

</p>

<p class="small">

	The maximum throughput is reciprocal of service time. R<sub>max</sub> = 1/&mu;.
	Figure 4 shows comparison between all four queues and Paxi implmentation. The result almost the same, the paper used M/D/1 model for the rest of analysis.
