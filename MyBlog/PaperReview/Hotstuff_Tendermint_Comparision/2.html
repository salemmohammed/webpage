  Recently, I have seen many research papers in distributed consensus that have started with promising ideas but have achieved more less than the promising itself. In distributed ledger technology space, there is a trade-off between new innovation and security, performance, or decentralization. This happens because of many reasons. My ultimate aim is to develop adaptive approach that could conveys the client requests to the right BFT protocol at runtime.

  The reason for choosing Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocols over other replicated protocols to improves on the blockchain is because of many emerging BFT consensus blockchain protocols, deep root in research with proofs and opensource implementations, and very well understood than the Bitcoin-based protocols. BFT is faster than Bitcoin-POW and has finality property. Other benefits are safety where more than ⅔ of the active delegates in the network follow the protocol honestly, two conflicting blocks can never be finalized on the chain. Liveness where ⅓ of the active delegates go offline, new blocks can still be finalized on the network. Accountability where If a delegate violates the protocol, he/she will be held accountable for it. Bitcoin systems are different than BFT systems in member information, performance, scalability, and probability vs certainty. To start simple, I will compare the between two state-of-art BFT protocols HotStuff and Tendermint to find out what they share in common. Before I dive into BFT protocols, let me take you back to the Bitcoin system.

  Previously I wrote about <a href="http://www.salemmoh.com/MyBlog/PaperReview/Bitcoin/Bitcoin.html">Bitcoin</a>. The Bitcoin mining process is what truly separates the P2P digital cash system from other forms of online payment. The concern is about centralization in mining. Only a few mining pools control the majority of the hashrate. This is not Satoshi's vision for the mining process which is one vote per computer. Another protocol called Ethereum. The Ethereum supports the contract and without any doubt, it is fully decentralized but learning solidity is not what most developers want to do. So, the Ethereum contract is missing users' and developers' simplicity.

  So it might be already obvious that BFT has advantages over POW. However, BFT naturally has no incentive for participants and to solve this incentive issue, we have a hybrid protocol scheme that combined BFT and POW called proof of stake (POS). POS-based systems use a locking mechanism to ensure every leader acts according to protocol rules. Otherwise, a validator gets punished by losing its stake(money) for instance Tendermint.

  BFT algorithms provide strong finality guarantees in that either all honest nodes will adopt a block or none will possibility of forks in Bitcoin but existing BFT algorithms do not scale well. Most actively used implementations scale to 100’s of participants, with some upcoming systems aiming to scale to 1000’s of participants with some sacrifices (e.g. increased block times).
  So why BFT is not scalable?... The answer is not that difficult. View change protocol in PBFT has message complexity O(n<sup>3</sup>) in the worst case and O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the best case. This view change protocol adopted in almost all the BFT protocols. So, to reach consensus on a block, the message complexity is O(n<sup>4</sup>) even with the threshold signature is still O(n<sup>3</sup>).

  So, after my long introduction I will dive on my main point. HotStuff is a leader-based BFT replication protocol proposed by VMware Research in March 2018 and Tendermint is also leader-based BFT proposed by Cosmos. Both are derivitive of PBFT and both and all adapt partial synchrony model. They obtain safety all the time and liveness after GST in the face of an adversary that controls (f) replicas out of a total of N=3f+1 replicas. HotStuff differs from Tendermint by providing both linearity and responsiveness while Tendermint view change is not responsive. Tendermint waits for the precommit timeout before moving to next view. A protocol is reponsive if it makes progress at the speed of the network without needing to wait for a predefined time out that is associated with the Partial synchrony model.

  Stable and rotated leaders are trade-off between less overhead and better performance due to stability when the leader is honest and trusted while a stable malicious leader can cause undetectable malicious actions. Constantly rotating the leader provides a stronger fairness guarantee after GST. Tendermint protocol does not have a wait period (time-out) in its view change phase to prevent malicious attacker from causing the system of violating liveness. This timeout happens on a critical path and Tendermint's progress will not be faster even if network delay is smaller than timeout period. HotStuff view change approach is both linear in complexity and responsive. HotStuff is not in all aspects better than Tendermint. HotStuff commit path induces a latency of 3 round instead of 2 in Tendermint.

  The basic HotStuff protocol works sequentially to commit each block in every 3 rounds. The Chained HotStuff protocol which is another type of HotStuff is amortized 1 block per round by using pipelining. Basically, each message sent is the first round message for some slot i, the second round message for slot i−1 and the third round message for slot i−2. See the figure below. HotStuff is a star communication network topology. Communication relies on leader and replicas are no more longer broadcasts the message to other nodes. The communication complexity of the system has been greatly reduced. Tendermint on the other hand is a mesh topology and every node communicates with every other node in the validator set.

<div class="w3-container"><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">

  Pipelining and chaining ideas could be adapted in other protocols to gain more performance. In the standard BFT SMR architecture, committing a block can be separated from executing it. Typically the execution must be sequential, and often after optimizing the commit throughput (via pipeline or concurrency) the sequential execution becomes the performance bottleneck for throughput.

<div class="w3-container"><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">

  The proposer in HotStuff does not collect view change report or disseminates them as proof of safety. On the other hand, a proposer in HotStuff does include in the proposal the highest level commit certificate (QC) it knows. The benefits of this approach reduces communication by factor n and combines signatures from multiple votes into one using threshold crypto reduces communication and crypto overhead on the replicas by another factor n.
  HotStuff and Tendermint have merge the view change process with the normal process to reduce the complexity of view change. It can be seen that during view change in HotStuff, a node in the system does not need to confirm the message enough nodes want to carry out view change before notifying the new leader, instead, it can directly switch to the new view and notifies the new leader.

  QC is associated with particular node and view number which contains n-f votes. Form a QC for B if 2f+1 votes collected. B is committed if there is a 3 chain B ← B’ ← B’’ ← B’’, where B parent of B’ parent of B’’ Only two kinds of messages propose and vote. Algorithm: Primary sends a message &#60;send,x,v&#62; to all replica where v is the view number and x is the value. Every replica responds &#60;ack,x,v&#62; on the first message in view v from the primary. primary waits for n-f &#60;ack,x,v&#62; and sends &#60;ack,x,v&#62; containing n-f ack signature. &#60;commit,x,v&#62; happens after n-f &#60;lock,x,v&#62; message.

  Proposals are encapsulated in blocks that extend branches of a block tree. Votes and QCs: HotStuff's Replicas store validators votes in blocks named commit certificates. When 2f+1 votes exist on a block they can form a Quorum Certificate (QC). A proposer always uses the highest QC it knows to choose which branch to extend. 
  <br>
  Commit rule: The decision when a block is considered committed rests purely on a simple graph structure, a three-chain, as depicted below. The head B of a three-chain has a QC(B) by a direct descendent B’; B’ has a QC(B’) by a direct descendet B”; and QC(B”) has has a QC.

  Pacemaker: The details of electing a proposer are encapsulated in an abstraction call a pacemaker, that needs to provide two guarantees: Infinitely often, all replicas spend a certain period of time jointly at a height, and a unique correct proposer is elected for the height.

  A naive way to achieve the pacemaker properties is by doubling the time each replica spends at each height until a decision is made. At each height, proposers can be rotated deterministically, they made be elected via a distributed pseudo random function, or they user a randomized back-off protocol.

  HotStuff is a three-phase BFT replication protocol. In HotStuff, the first and second phases of a round are similar to PBFT, but the result of the second phase is a certified certificate, or a QC-of-QC, rather then a commit decision. A commit decision is reached upon getting a quorum of votes on the QC-of-QC (a QC-of-QC-of-QC).

  <table>
  <tr>
      <th>HotStuff</th>
      <th>Tendermint</th>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <th>The result of the second phase is a certified certificate</th>
      <th>The result of the second phas is a commit decision.</th>
    </tr>

  In both Hotstuff and Tendermint, they have one thing in common which that they are not scale. Their maximum deployment are 100 nodes. In Tendermint, authors have mentioned that after 10 years, their vision to reach 300 validators. I guess the reason they both choose 100 because beyond the 100 they network did not scale and performance is degregated due to communication bottlenecks. 

<center>
  <table>
  <tr>
      <th>HotStuff</th>
      <th>Tendermint</th>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <th>The maximum deployment are 100 nodes</th>
      <th>The maximum deployment are 100 nodes</th>

  Hotstuff improves the view change message complexity of PBFT by a factor of O(n) (dropping view change message complexity from O(n<sup>3</sup>) to O(n<sup>2</sup>). But during normal execution its message complexity matches that of PBFT (O(n<sup>2</sup>)). It also relaxes the BFT finality condition to merge the prepare phase of the next proposal with the current commit phase. Tendermint combines BFT and Proof-of-Stack (Pos) into a single protocol. An important aspect of Tenderment is the use of rotating leader election, where after each block, a new leader is selected deterministically. More stake for a validator is translated into more voting power and proportionally more times to be selected as a leader. But it suffers liveness issue due to conflicting proposals
