<div class="w3-container"><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">
	In a state machine replication (SMR) or consensus protocols, a set of nodes seek to agree on a linearly-ordered log based on two properties: consistency where all servers must have the same view of the log, and livness where a client request evenually added to the log. Thunderella is a practical solution for SMR, that combined a fast, asynchronous path with a slow synchronous path. Thunderella can work in permission and permissionless settings.

<div class="w3-container"><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">
	
	Generally, consensus protocol can be responsiveness if the transactions confirmed by the honest node in a time that depends only on the actual network delay plus a majority condition which is 2/3 of the players are honest. In Thunderella, optimistic responsiveness is limiting responsiveness to a good condition under two cases. First, when we have a worst case condition W with majority are honest, where protocol guarantee the worest case of consistency and slow comfmation. Second, optimistic case O with majority 3/4 are honest, and responsive confirmation with an honest leader.

</p></div>
<div class="w3-container"><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">

	So, Thunderella satisfies liveness and consistency under conditions W, and satisfies optimistic responsivness under condtion O.

	In a nutshell the protocol has a designated leader. The leader receives the transactions and sends out the signed transaction to a committee of players. If a trnsaction has received more than 3/4 of the committees signatures, the protocol refers to such a transaction as being notarized.

</p></div>
<div class="w3-container"><p style="color:black;font-size:20px;">

  In permissioned Thunderella setting, the committee memebers are all the players W' = W where W' for committee members and W for all players. This will envolve high communication overhead. To improve the protocol under this setting, sub-sampling committee memebers from all players frequently to ensure corruption does not controll the sampling.

  In permissioned and permission-less Thunderella setting, the committee will be the recent miners for the recent blocks.
