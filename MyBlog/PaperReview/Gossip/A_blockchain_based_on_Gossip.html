	This is a position paper written by Robbert van Renesse. 
	<br><br>
	<b>What is blockchain?</b> <br>
	A blockchain is an append-only sequence of blocks of arbitrary data.<br>

	<br>
	<b>What types of Blockchain approaches are there?</b> <br>
	The two most popular approaches.
	<ol>
		<li> Permissionless blockchains based on Proof of Work (PoW) </li>
		 The issue with PoW approaches: energy, low throughput, high latency.
		<li> Permissioned blockchains based on Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).</li>
			The membership is closed
	</ol>
</p>
<p class="small">
	
	So, how to address the problems for both types?<br>
	<b> Gossip </b>approach. <br>
	Gossip is an approach to agreement in so-called eventually consistent systems.

	In a basic gossip protocol, there is a fixed group of participants. Periodically, each participant randomly selects a peer and exchanges state. 
	This state is reconciled in a way so that all nonfaulty participants eventually converge to the same state. It can be shown that this approach is efficient, converging in O(log N) gossip rounds where N is the number of participants, even in the face of participants failures and message loss. 
	Moreover, gossip protocols are amenable to open and dynamic membership whereby the membership itself is gossiped along with other state.
	
</p>
<p class="small">
	
	How participants agree on the block? <br>

	The simple approach is to order blocks according to some agreed-upon metric. 
	Each participant would simply keep track of the maximum block that it has heard from and gossip this block, possibly along with membership information.

	A participant would only consider blocks that contains a history hash matching its concept of the block agreed upon in the last epoch. If all participants were honest, then this approach would lead to a very high likelihood that all participants agree on the maximum among the proposed blocks at the end of the epoch.
</p>

<p class="small">
	
	Unfortunately, a Byzantine participant could introduce one or more new blocks that are
higher than the previous maximum in the last few rounds of the epoch and cause the participants
to end up disagreeing with one another. 
This is similar to the concept of forks in PoW chains,
where miners advertise new blocks at approximately the same time, either accidentally or with
selfish intention. In Bitcoin chains, this is resolved by the longest-chain-wins policy: when one
branch in the fork has become longer than the other(s), the longest branch becomes part of the
main chain. Because it is highly unlikely that branches both keep adding a block at exactly the
same times, forks are metastable.
</p>

<p class="small">
	
	Can we create a gossip protocol that is also metastable in a way that once agreement has
been reached it would be very hard to destabilize it? The answer is yes. Instead of ordering the
blocks a priori based on some metric, the participants use a randomized approach that converges
with high probability. In this approach, each participant keeps track of a table with a row for
each peer (including self). Each row in the table contains
• a unique identifier for the peer;
• a gossip round number for the peer;
• the peer’s favorite block in that round;
• a public key signature to prevent forging and tampering.
</p>


<p class="small">
	In order to prevent an attack whereby a participant tries to gossip with every other participant
in every gossip round, we use a pull gossip: a correct participant explicitly requests the state
of k randomly chosen peers in each round, rather than sending its state to the peers. This way
each correct participant updates its state based on that of at most k participants in each round.
In the rest of this paper, we use k = 1.
</p>

<p class="small">
	
	With open membership, a Sybil attack is possible on the membership of the protocol described
thus far. We leverage that, although it is easy to spoof an IP return address in an IP packet, it is not easy to subvert routing and receive messages on a spoofed IP address. An adversary is thus
limited by the number of public IP addresses that it actually has control over. More specifically,
we propose that peers use TLS connections with endpoints identified by IP address.
</p>

<p class="small">
	
	We will now address is why somebody would deploy a node to participate in the proposed
blockchain. In other words, what incentivizes participants?

Some incentive comes from trans
action fees. We would like, however, to pay participants for their work just like miners get paid
for their work, if probabilistically.
In general, it is hard to prove for participants that they have actively participated in the
gossip protocol. We propose to use platforms such as Intel SGX to provide such proofs. We
envision that certified gossip code is released. When deployed in an SGX enclave, the code will
acquire a timestamp from a certified time source, gossip for 24 hours, and provide a proof of
correct execution. This proof can then be used to obtain renumeration in the next 24 hours.
We envision that a certain amount of funds is distributed daily to all participants who can
prove (using SGX or otherwise) that they have run the code during the previous 24 hour period.
Note that unlike proposed blockchain protocols based on SGX such as PoET / Sawtooth Lake
(intelledger.github.io), we do not rely on SGX for the correctness of the protocol—we only rely
on SGX to renumerate participants.
</p>

<p class="small">
	
	At this point, a gossip-based blockchain is just a preliminary proposal, another point in the
design space of blockchains, combining low energy with relatively open membership. Although it
can most likely be sped up, in its proposed form it has the same (low) throughput as the Bitcoin
blockchain but uses significantly less energy. Latency is at most 10 minutes, whereas for Bitcoin
the latency until a block can be trusted to persist is closer to an hour. However, particularly in
a permissionless environment, much analysis and refinement will need to happen to ensure that
gossip-based blockchains can be trusted for critical applications.
