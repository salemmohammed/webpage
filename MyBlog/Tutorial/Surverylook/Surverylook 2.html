	Reaching Agreement is a very important task in distributed systems. There are three correctness conditions that every reader has to understand, consistency, validity, and termination. Consistency means that all correct processes agree on the same value and all the decisons are final. Validaity means that if all processes start with the same intial value v, then v is the only allowable decsion for all processes. Termination means that all correct processes reach a decision.

	The first two for safety and the last for liveness. These are very hard in real world applications to hold all the time for verities of reason such as broken link, network congestion and network partitions. Achiving reliabliltiy in distributed systems protocols are needed which enable the system as a whole to continue to function despite the failure of some number of componenets.

	Lamport shows that the consensus can never be reached even between two processes if there is a link failure under the assumption that the link do not display any kind of fault. Process fault is fail-stop where process fails by stop or byzantine failure where process fails arbitrarlly. The problem of solving consensus in the presence of byzantine failures is knows as the byzantine agreement problem.

	In the past, researchers have tried to optimze either the message complexity or round complexity of algorithms in the worst case senarios. Experimental evaluation can help greatly by providing detailed resutls on guarantees of algorithms. In real world systems, communication bandwidth may exist which are not considered in theoritical resutls.

	While there has been a lot of attention paid towards the blockchain technoglyg, and consensus protocols, there have been relatively none survey conducted the consensus algorithm only.

	In [14] that compares performance results using bit complexity, rounds complexity, and latency matrics between three algorithms. Algorithm quorum: at the end of the protocol, every process output value and a number that denotes the confidence of the process in that value. Every honest process will output the same value with full confidence. Algorithm pull-push has two phases pull and push as the name suggested. In the push phase, the process receives information about their candidate value from other processes without asking for it. In the pull phase, the process requests the value it received in the push phase to be verified by some other processes. The exponential information gathering algorithm has two phases. In the first phase, the process communicates for every other process for k+1 rounds and in the second phase, evaluation is done in every process's tree.

	In [15], presents overview of famous protocols and states the trade-off among security, scalability efficiency and perforamnce. In [1], shows an overview of the consensus protocol being used in the context of permission blockchain. In [10], a good comparison of consensus algorithms for use with permissioned and permissionless blockchains was provided. In [16], the authors presents a study of the relationship between blockchain protocols and byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols.

  In [7], is classifying consensus space based on proof based and vote based consensus protocols. The authors argue that vote-based consensus protocols are more suitable for permission blockchain whereas proof-based consensus protocols are more suitable for public blockchains. In [20], presents the design methodologies for distributed consensus system and incentive mechanism in blockchain. In [21], provides a broad analysis of various optimization techniques and approaches used in recent protocols to scale Byzantine consensus for large environments such as BFT blockchain infrastructures.
