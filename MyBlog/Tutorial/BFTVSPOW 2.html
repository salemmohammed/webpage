	In distributed systems and multi-agent systems, there are many processes running in the same time. Some of the running process might fail or attach by malicious node. In order to keep system reliable, processes in the system have to agree on some data value that is needed to complete computations.

	Consensus algorithm in Blockchain. 
	What consensus provides for blockchain is the ensurance that a next block in a blockchain is validated and secured. 
	First one called POW stand for proof of work. It used in Bitcoin and it process the block and add the new block to blockchain. 
	Second is called proof of stake. Here individuals who generate a block known as validators, depend on their economic state in the network.  
	Third one called proof of burn. The idea is that the user burning the cryptocurrency shows long-term commitment to the coin by burning it, while receiving his or her gains much later.

	Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). It's a consensus algorithm and derived form Byzantine generals' problem.
	BFT is the ability of reaching an agreement with existance of malicious components in the system. The main point is to prevent any catastrophic system failures by mitigating the influence that these malicious nodes may have on the correct function of the netowrk. One of optimization for this algorithm is called practical byzantine fault tolerance.
