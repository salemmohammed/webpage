	DAG is stand for directed acyclic graph data structure. It is known as the solution for blockchain scalability problem. 
	Befroe I go deeply in cryptography, let me remind you what is the DAG and where is it used.
	DAG is a graph with no directed cycle. It consists of nodes and edges that have some meaning based on applications. Each edge is directed from one node to another. DAG is often applied to problems related to the following: Data processing, Scheduling, Finding the best route in navigation, and Data compression.

<p class="small">
	DAG is known as an alternative to the blockchain architecture. DAG is similar to blockchain in a way that it has set of nodes and transactions. There is no blocks and miners in DAG architecture. Instead, DAG provides a kind of chain where transactions linked from one to another, and identified by their hashes. The nodes in DAG carry a proof-of-work reference the transactions for previou two nodes. Therefore, the process of transaction confirmation is much more lightweight and transaction fees are reduced to zero.
