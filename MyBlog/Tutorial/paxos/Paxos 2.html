<p class="small">

	Distributed systems are implemented for high availability and scalability using many commodity machines. Such machines are not reliable entities and these come up and go down quite often. Paxos is a family of distributed algorithms used to reach consensus among many computer nodes. Put in plain English, the Paxos trying to solve a problem that a system with a number of computers will agree on some value when asynchronously one client or more clients proposed different value(s). <br><br>

</p>

<p class="small">

	There are three basic roles that take place in Paxos consensus.
	<ul> 
		<li> Proposers: propose a value for consensus </li>
		<li> Acceptors: choose the consensus value</li>
		<li> Learners:  learn the consensus value</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
</p>

<p class="small">

	<b> Note: </b> A single process may take on multiple roles - that is, act as more than one agent. <br> The process can be proposer (P), acceptor (A), or learner (L).

	The number of acceptors has to be >= F+1, where F is number of failure servers. Let's just go with F+1 and it can be any F+1 servers in the cluster.
	<br><br>
	<b> Accepting proposals: </b> <br>

	Once a value has been chosen by the majority of the network, future proposals must propose the same value.

	This means a two-phase protocol would be needed. In the first phase, proposers need to figure out if any value has already been chosen and propose in the second phase.
	<br><br>

	<b> Ballot Number: </b> <br>
	
	An easy way to order proposals is to have an unique ballot number for each proposal in the form of (seq_id, server_id). In order to guarantee ordering, seq_id has to be persisted cross crash/restart. So it has to be durably stored locally.


	Now we are all set up to describe the real two-phase Paxos protocol. We will call the first phase the prepare phase and second phase the accept phase. 
	prepare phase serves two purposes in one round trip. <br>
	1- learn about any value that's already chosen.<br>
	2- prevent acceptors accepting any older proposals.
</p>
<p class="small">
	
	<b> Prepare phase </b> <br>
	
	In this phase, proposer tries to get a promise from acceptor to not accept any proposals older than his. At the same time, acceptors will inform the proposers what values have already been accepted so far.
	<br>

	example bank system: <br>

	1- A server (called a proposer) proposes what it thinks is the correct balance to the rest of the servers (called acceptors). <br>

	2- Rest of the servers look at this proposal and either accept or reject it. <br>

	3- If a majority of the servers accept, then the balance is chosen to be the actual balance and is broadcast to all the servers (called learners). <br>

	Rules that system has to follow to avoid a problem from conflict:<br>

	1- Each proposal should be of the form < n, v > where n is a strictly increasing proposal number and v is the balance. Think of each proposal as a ‘retry’ and the proposal number represents the number of retries so far. <br>

	2- A proposer sends a proposal of this form to other servers (acceptors). This is called a prepare request.<br>

	3- When an acceptor receives a prepare request, it will respond with a promise that it will not accept any other requests with a lower proposal number. For example, if the proposal is <5, 100> then the acceptor will not accept any requests of the form < i, v> where i < 5. This also means that if the acceptor has already responded to a proposal of the form < i, v> where i > 5, then <5, 100> will be rejected or it may choose not to respond at all and simply ignore the request. <br>
 
	4- If the acceptor has already accepted proposals in the past, then it will respond to the current proposal <5, 100> with < i, v> in addition to the promise above. Here < i, v> is the proposal where i is the greatest number less than 5. For example, if it has accepted <1, 20>, <2, 30> and <4, 40> in the past, it will respond with <4, 40>. <br>

	5- When the proposer receives these responses from a majority of acceptors, then it will send an accept request to each of these acceptors with proposal number 5. The balance in the proposal could be either a) a new balance or b) the balance in the highest numbered proposal of all the responses. So if point 3 above applies, then the proposal will be <5, 100> or if point 4 applies, the proposal will be <5, 40> <br>.

	6- When an acceptor receives this accept request, it will accept it only if it has not responded to another prepare request in the mean time with a higher proposal number. <br>

	7- If acceptor accepts the request, it then broadcasts it to all the other servers (learners) that it has accepted it. Since a majority of servers do this, this accepted value will be the agreed value of the whole system. <br>

The first, Paxos, addresses the issue of non-Byzantine distributed asynchronous network consensus；

consensus means agreement.

There are various reasons why we want it: to agree on who gets access to a resource (mutual exclusion), agree on who is in charge (elections), or to agree on a common ordering of events among a collection of computers (e.g., what action to take next, or state machine replication).

Replication may be the most common use of consensus. We set up collections (clusters) of servers, all of which will have replicated content. This provides fault tolerance: if any server dies, others are still running. It also provides scale: clients can read data from any available server although writing data will generally require the use of all servers and not scale as well. For many applications, though, reads far outnumber writes. To keep the content replicated, we have two design choices. We can funnel all write requests through one coordinator, which will ensure in-order delivery to all replicas or we can send updates to any system but that system will coordinate those updates with its replicas to ensure that all updates are applied in the same order on each replica. In the first case, we need consensus to elect that coordinator. In the second case, we need to run a consensus algorithm for each update to ensure that everyone agrees on the order.

The formal properties for asynchronous consensus are:

Validity: only the proposed values can be decided. If a process decides on some value, v, then some process must have proposed v.
Uniform Agreement: no two correct processes (those that do not crash) can decide on different values.
Integrity: each process can decide a value at most once.
Termination: all processes will eventually decide on a result.

Paxos is an algorithm that is used to achieve consensus among a distributed set of computers that communicate via an asynchronous network. One or more clients proposes a value to Paxos and we have consensus when a majority of systems running Paxos agrees on one of the proposed values. Paxos is widely used and is legendary in computer science since it is the first consensus algorithm that has been rigorously proved to be correct.
